        <p class="testimony">Welcome, Thank you for visiting CMG Pro Films. It&apos;s both an honor and a pleasure to introduce others to my passion for filmmaking and photography. CMG Pro started 2 years ago, with a passion for creativity and all types of media. We have been able to create projects for many different types of clients, from artists looking to create and build a name with their music, to business owners looking to expand their brand with promotional videos and commercials, and even sports teams looking to highlight their players exceptional achievements. Filmmaking is an ART that cannot be simply achieved from your phone's camera! The ability to create high quality media has allowed me to put smiles on peoples faces, and generate lasting digital souvenirs. Many times, people try to capture memories on a cell phone, BUT what ends up happening is, they end up distracted, removing themselves from being able to live in the moment and completely immerse themselves in the NOW. Those times are way more important to go home with shaky handheld memories that FAIL to encapsulate the entire event. Plus, if you are taking the video by yourself, you canâ€™t even be in that memory, leaving you to ask others for pictures and videos that include you as well. Now you are stuck with low quality memories of that time you wore your favorite outfit and cleanest kicks! That is where CMG Pro Films comes in! Let us take care of your next event, music video, or commercial business needs! We are always ready, willing, and able to provide exceptional customer service, and quality that far surpasses even what the latest and greatest iPhone can deliver!
            <br>
            Yours Truly,
            <br> 
            CMG Pro
